The purpose of this git repository is to store all assignments and labs competed
during Comp20: Web Programming. 

My favorite lab or assignment was assignment 3, while it was one of the more 
conceptually difficult assignments and very different to what many other courses
teach in terms of material, it was one of the most rewarding assignments to 
test, fix and debug. 

I think that I find the task of web programming less daunting, the online side 
of programming seems more approachable than it did prior to taking this course.

The most important thing that I have learned from this course is the importance
of taking responsibility for your own education. During the coding for 
assignment 2 and assignment 3 there were many times that I found guidance from 
stack overflow or other coding sites through thorough questions. Specifically 
for clarification on changing the CORs policy in different sections of 
assignment 3 and details about the google maps API in assignment 2. 

Now that we've finish the course I am most interested in learning more about
online security.
