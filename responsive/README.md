Correctly implemented: Implemented a responsive webpage using only the css, 
using screen width and separating sections of one image to display on the 
webpage. Each section of the image is displayed only for a specified width of 
the web screen and all the images come from one larger image. 

Collaberation/discussion: Help from TA's Robert and Kingsley for troublshooting 
disappearing images as well as faulty coordinates 

Time spent: 8 hours
