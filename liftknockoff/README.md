Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not:
I have implemented javascript coding that accepts data from an outside sources, 
uses JSON.parse to parse through the data and create icons according to what the 
data contains. The code checks for the readystatechanges while reading in the data, 
only running the rest of the code if the status of the data is good and the data is 
ready to be read. The code is able to recognize the username for the WEINERMOBILE, 
creates markers that inform the user how far the car or passenger is from the 
user's position. The code correctly implements 3rd party Javascript API, uses HTML5
geolocation API and uses the XMLHttpRequest object to make requests and retrieve 
data.
